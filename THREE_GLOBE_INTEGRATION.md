# Three-Globe Integration

## Overview
This document describes the integration of the three-globe library into the Marine Explorer application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added three-globe dependency
```bash
npm install three-globe
```

### 2. Created new ThreeGlobe component
- **File**: `src/components/ThreeGlobe.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Replaces the original Globe component with three-globe library
- **Features**:
  - Real Earth texture from NASA Blue Marble
  - Topology bump mapping
  - Atmospheric effects
  - Color-coded data points by water body
  - Smooth rotation animation

### 3. Updated GlobeView component
- **File**: `src/components/GlobeView.tsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Import changed from `Globe` to `ThreeGlobeComponent`
  - Component usage updated in Canvas

### 4. Preserved original Globe component
- **File**: `src/components/Globe.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Kept as backup in case three-globe integration needs to be reverted

## Features

### Visual Enhancements
- **Earth Texture**: High-resolution NASA Blue Marble imagery
- **Topology**: 3D bump mapping for realistic terrain
- **Atmosphere**: Glowing atmospheric effect in marine cyan
- **Data Points**: Color-coded by water body:
  - Arabian Sea: Green (#00ff88)
  - Bay of Bengal: Yellow (#ffd700)
  - Andaman Sea: Cyan (#00d4ff)
  - Other: Orange (#ff6b35)

### Performance
- **WebGL Optimized**: Uses three-globe's optimized WebGL rendering
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Points are rendered as instanced geometry
- **Smooth Animation**: 60fps rotation with useFrame hook

### Data Visualization
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Points positioned using lat/lng coordinates
- **Interactive**: Click and hover support (basic implementation)
- **Scalable**: Handles large datasets efficiently

## Usage

The ThreeGlobe component accepts the same props as the original Globe component:

```tsx
<ThreeGlobeComponent 
  dataPoints={dataPoints} 
  onDataPointClick={setSelectedDataPoint} 
/>
```

## Benefits over Original Globe

1. **Better Performance**: Optimized WebGL rendering
2. **Realistic Appearance**: Actual Earth textures and topology
3. **Professional Look**: High-quality visual presentation
4. **Scalability**: Better handling of large datasets
5. **Maintained Library**: Active development and community support

## Fallback

If issues arise with three-globe, the original Globe component is preserved and can be restored by:
1. Changing the import in `GlobeView.tsx` back to `Globe`
2. Updating the component usage in the Canvas
